This app has the following features: 

* Settings Locker
    * Allows you to lock your keybinding settings / other in game settings for League of Legends, so that when switching between accounts, you will carry your settings from one account to another.
    * Also causes your settings from the first account to overwrite subsequent accounts, providing you a way to transfer settings from one account to another. 
    * Functions by locking/unlocking the 'game.cfg' and 'persistedsettings.json' files in your C:\Riot Games\Config\ directory, which will force your settings from one account to another.
 * Forcibly close and reopen Riot Client / League of Legends

# Setup
